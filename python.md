## Some basic python notes

### Getting started
* start up python with `python3`
* `print("Hello World")`
* Version 2.7 (on which a lot of software was built) is no longer supported
* Try some basic calculations
* Try `word = "string test"` then `word[0]`, `word[1]`, `word[1 : 2]` 
* Try `word2 = "string test2"` then `word + word`
