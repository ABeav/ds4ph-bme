This HW is due 4/9/2020

Consider the shhs dataset from the previouis HW. 

* Use squared error loss and the variables waist, age, sex and bmi to predict log(rdi4p + 1). Interpet the coefficients.
* Define sleep disordered breathing as having an rdi4p greater than 15. Use logistic regression to fit a model on having sleep disordered breathing using waist, age, sex and bmi as predictors. Interpret your coefficients.
* Use a logistic regresion model to predict HTNDerv_S1 using age, sex, bmi and rdi4p. Interpret the rdi4p coefficient.

More HW to come, be sure to check back at the course repo!

What you should hand in to the github assignment repo:

An R Markdown notebook with your solutions and description of your solutions for all but the python questions.
A pdf of the rendered vesion of your R markdown notebook.
