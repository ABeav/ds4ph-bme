Please turn in the assignment as a single complied R markdown document. Include the Rmd and HTML files. 

* Use [neuroconductor](https://neuroconductor.org/package/kirby21.mricloud) to download the kirby 21 MRICloud data. Use [this package](https://neuroconductor.org/package/MRIcloudT1volumetrics) to read in the first
subject. Calculate and report the intracranial volume: the sum of the level 1 type 1 volumes. 
* Read in the class data from here [https://github.com/bcaffo/ds4bme/blob/master/data/classInterests.txt](https://github.com/bcaffo/ds4bme/blob/master/data/classInterests.txt). Use ggplot to create bar plots of year and program. 
* Create a mosaic plot of the class data for year and program.
* Download the gene expression dataset from [here](https://github.com/jhu-advdatasci/2018/blob/master/data/GSE5859_exprs.csv). Download the sample info [here](https://github.com/jhu-advdatasci/2018/blob/master/data/GSE5859_sampleinfo.csv). Plot a heatmap of the data. Subtract the rowmean from each row and the column mean from each column.
* Download the data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhu-advdatasci/2018/master/data/KFF/healthcare-spending.csv). Create plots of healthcare spending versus time color coded by states.
