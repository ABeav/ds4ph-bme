* Consider the dataset `x = c(1.57, 1.25, 2.80, 0.43)`. Suppose we want to minimize the weighted version of least squares for `mu`
given by `sum( w * (x - mu) ^ 2 )` where `w = c(2, 2, 1, 1)`. That is, the first two observation are weighted double the second two. What
is the optimal value of `mu`?
* Consider the `shhs` datset distributed over slack. Use linear regression with 
  `bmi` to predict `log(rdi4p + 1)`. Report the coefficients and a scatterplot with the fitted line.
* Using your formula from the previous question, predict `rdi4p` for a person with a `bmi = 30`. 
* Refer to your regresion model fit, interpret the coefficients (mean and intercept).

Repeat these questions in an colab notebook using python

* Consider the `shhs.txt` datset distributed over slack. Use linear regression with 
  `bmi` to predict `log(rdi4p + 1)`. Report the coefficients and a scatterplot with the fitted line.
* Using your formula from the previous question, predict `rdi4p` for a person with a `bmi = 30`. 



What you should hand in to the github assignment repo: 

* An R Markdown notebook with your solutions and description of your solutions for all but the python questions.
* A pdf of the rendered vesion of your R markdown notebook.
* A colab notebook with your solution to the python questions. 

So, your assignment git repo should have 3 files, an R markdown notebook, a pdf, and a colab notebook file.
