* Chapter 4, problems 10 - 13
* Create a boxplot of gender by rdi4p. 
* Perform a permutation test of whether mean rdi4p differs by gender. Use the difference in the means as the test statistic.
* Consider the dataset `c(1.1, 3.4, 8.5)`. List out all possible bootstrap resampled datasets.
* You would like to test whether or not a coin is fair. You flip it 15 times. What number of heads would you have to get or more to have a type I error rate of 5%?
* Refer to the previous problem. You got 10 heads. What is the associated P-vaue? Would you reject at the 5% level?
